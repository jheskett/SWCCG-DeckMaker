SW:CCG Delimited Data Specification

INTRODUCTION

  I originally wrote these files to ease my production of spoilers for
  SW:CCG.  They were made to be easy to write in your favorite text editor
  (vile) and easy for regular expressions to chew on. I've done my best
  to eliminate spelling errors, particularly in the icon fields. Since
  they were made for human readable input/output, little effort was made
  to make it easy to generate machine readable lists. David Sisson took
  it upon himself to write Perl code to convert between these data files
  and Jeff Heskett's (now defunct) DeckMaker data files; Proving that
  it can be done relatively easily, with the correct tools.

DATAFILE

  o Each line in the datafile is a separate card.
  o Each field is separated by a semicolon (;)
  o Depending on content, fields may have 0 to n characters.
  o There is no escape for representing a (;) in a field. Sorry.
  o Any text which should be represented in bold is surrounded by
    curly braces. This is for words like {Thief}, {Cumulatively},
    {Gunner}, etc.
  o There is no escape for representing a curly brace "{", "}". Sorry.

  
  Common Fields

    o Every card has the first 7 fields in common:

      1. Side of the force: 1 Character
        l : light
        d : dark

      2. Type: 1 Character
        c : character
        d : device
        e : effect
        E : event

      8. Destiny: String
        Although usually a single character for the destiny, some cards make
        it difficult to represent their destiny this way. Eg. Brainiac's
        destiny is pi, difficult to represent in ASCII.
      9. Statistics: String
        In the form "P:n A:n D:n R:n F:n" where P=power, A=Ability, R=Armor,
        D=Deploy F=Forfeit; Characters not having one of the statistics
        will simply be missing that statistic, eg Droids do not have Ability.
